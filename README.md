My currently ongoing mobile project, DANCER. 
A bullet hell that aims to utilize the touch interface to its absolute fullest,
the interface includes a dedicated control area to avoid the players finger overlapping with visuals
as well as design spesifics like a smaller area to move in to make quick manuvers more accessible. 
DANCER is controlled with a single finger, and is intended to be able to be played one handed.
